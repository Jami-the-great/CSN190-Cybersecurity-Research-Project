## For this project I cloned the Digital-Forensics-Guide repository from GitHub, and explored it in VS Code using GitHub Copilot for guidance. This repository, isn't a program you run.... It's more like a large digital textbook that introduces different forensic tools used by cybersecurity professionals. My goal was, to understand how to navigate it, explore the documentation and pick one beginner friendly tool to try hands on. From the guide's list of options I chose Wireshark, a network forensics tool used to capture and analyze live network traffic. But then my Mac wasn't compatible with the latest version, so I had to find a older version (4.4.10). In my Wireshark capture I was able to see real network traffic, from my own device including DNS queries, TCP handshakes and encrypted TLS packets. This kind of data is what forensic analysts use to reconstruct how a system communicates and to detect abnormal patterns or potential security threats. I also followed Copilot's step by step "todos" process to explore the repository, analyze its files and identify a beginner friendly tool I could test. That process ended up being way longer than I expected (almost 10 hours ) of waiting for Copilot to finish scanning, reading documentation and loading data. At one point it froze completely and I needed help figuring out whether to restart or continue. I ended up restarting like 6 times before it finally completed. Copilot didn't do everything for me but it guided me like a teammate, explaining errors, suggesting commands and helping me stay on track when things got frustrating. Despite the long process it taught me patience and persistence..... Two things that matter just as much as technical skill in digital forensics.
