This guide explains how I created the virtual lab environment used for my CSN 190 Final Cybersecurity Project.  
I used **VirtualBox**, **Ubuntu Linux**, and **Autopsy** to perform a digital autopsy on a disk image.

## 🖥️ Host System Requirements

Before starting, I made sure my laptop could handle a virtual machine:

| Requirement | Minimum | What I Used |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| RAM | 4GB | 8GB (4GB to VM) |
| Storage | 40GB free | 60GB free |
| Virtualization Enabled | Yes | Yes |

Everything was done **inside the VM**, so my real computer stayed safe.

## 1️⃣ Install VirtualBox

1. Went to the Oracle VirtualBox website  
2. Downloaded the version for macOS  
3. Installed using default settings
 

---

## 2️⃣ Download Ubuntu ISO

- Downloaded Ubuntu Desktop 64-bit ISO from official Ubuntu website
- Saved it in Downloads so VirtualBox could find it easily

## 3️⃣ Create the Virtual Machine

Inside VirtualBox:

| Setting | Value |
|--------|------|
| Name | CSN190-PROJECT |
| Type | Linux |
| Version | Ubuntu (64-bit) |
| RAM | 4096 MB |
| CPUs | 2 |
| Storage | 40GB dynamically allocated |

## 4️⃣ Install Ubuntu Linux

Steps:

1. Started VM → Selected the Ubuntu ISO as startup disk
2. Followed default installation options:
   - “Normal installation”
   - Enabled 3rd-party software
3. Created Ubuntu login user + password
4. reboot after install completed

Then I reached the Ubuntu desktop successfully ✔️
