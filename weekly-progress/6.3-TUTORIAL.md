# Introduction
For this project I worked with the Digital-Forensics-Guide repository from GitHub. A
huge resource packed guide, for anyone learning about digital forensics. It’s not a
program you run but more like an opensource textbook that collects useful tools and
explains what they’re used for. My goal was to explore it through VS Code with
GitHub Copilot, understand how to navigate its documentation and pick one beginner
friendly forensic tool to test out for real. I chose to actually test in my VM: Autopsy.

For my specific task I followed the section in the repository, that explains how to use
Autopsy a popular forensic GUI used to analyze disk images. My goal was to~
• Launch Autopsy
• Create a case
• Add a test image
• Analyze the file system (view files, extract data, view metadata)
My goal was simple..... Take a real test disk image, open it in Autopsy and explore
what kind of evidence a forensic examiner would actually see. I created a case, added
a host, mounted the image and went through files, timestamps, and even keyword
search results. It was cool, seeing how Autopsy breaks everything down so vividly.
This matters because disk image investigations are basically the heart of digital
forensics...... Every deleted file, strange timestamp, or hidden text file tells a story.
And getting hands on with Autopsy helped me understand how investigators actually
uncover those stories. This project was genuinely hands on and emotional in the best
way (frustrating, funny, tiring and extremely satisfying) once the evidence finally
popped up on Autopsy.
# Prerequisites.... Before starting I needed a few things ready forsure
• VS Code (with Git + GitHub Copilot enabled)
• Ubuntu VM (VirtualBox)
• Autopsy installed (version 4.20.1)
• Firefox browser
• Patience because Autopsy WILL break at least once!!!!!
• Terminal access/ Basic terminal knowledge....

# Step By Step Tutorial
Below are the exact steps I took, including the moments that worked smoothly and the
ones that made me question my life choices.

## Step 1 — Open the Digital-Forensics-Guide Repository in VS Code

I opened the entire GitHub repo in VS Code to explore its sections on disk analysis,
forensic imaging, evidence handling and Autopsy references.

# Step 2 — Explore Repo Sections & Plan My Task

When I first started this project, the plan was to download a sample forensic image
from the Digital-Forensics-Guide or one of the public datasets. But none of the images
I tried would download correctly. Every link I clicked gave me errors like:
• “NoSuchKey”
• “The specified key does not exist”
• Dead links from old forensic datasets
No matter what I clicked, nothing would download cleanly. That’s when I asked
ChatGPT for help and the chat helped me figure out a better idea: I should create my
own forensic image using the VM I already had running.

# Step 3 —: Launch Autopsy Using Terminal
![TERMINAL](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84b97b3b-ca2c-4276-9fab-dbfd7093c908)

Autopsy doesn’t open like a normal app. It needs to run from the terminal. Once the
server starts running, it opens the browser version.

# Step 4 — Open Autopsy in Firefox
![AUTOPSYIMAGE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d65fd7f9-8866-4083-bedc-f45675f55f85)

Autopsy loads in the browser and shows the dashboard where I create new cases.

# Step 5 — Create a New Case
![CREATE CASE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90a544a5-8d7f-4407-a1bf-87ee83b19703)

I created a forensic case with a name, description, and storage folder. Autopsy
organizes evidence under each case to keep investigations clean.

# Step 6 — Add the Host and Attach the .dd Image I Created
![HOST](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e19220e7-6245-4dfa-8255-0c7521944028)

I added a new host, then selected my manually created disk image (Testimage2.dd).
This is where Autopsy starts analyzing the file system inside the .dd.

# Step 7 — Analyze the Evidence and Open Files
![EVIDENCE1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8638a2b0-d8ab-4148-b5ef-7481f2281ec2)
![EVIDENCE2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7db2cca3-034d-455f-9476-ca9cf157843c)

Autopsy successfully loaded the file system from my custom forensic image. I opened
files like password.txt and saw the content (“Thegreat1234.”). This confirmed my .dd
image was correctly created and Autopsy could analyze it.

# Step 4- Expected Results

If everything is working, the investigator should:
• Successfully run Autopsy from terminal
• Access GUI at port 9999
• Create a case
• Add a host and insert an image
• Browse directories and files
• View ASCII and Hex mode
• Read file contents
• View metadata
• Perform keyword search
These results demonstrate that Autopsy is correctly processing the evidence image and
presenting readable forensic artifacts.

# 5. Troubleshooting

Here are the issues I ran into and how I fixed them:

Autopsy didn’t open when clicking the launcher
Solution: Run it manually using ./autopsy in terminal.

Autopsy wouldn’t let me add a case or image
Solution:I deleted the broken host folder in /Cases/, restarted Autopsy, and created a
fresh case.

Image wouldn’t mount / File Analysis was grayed out
Solution: Only add the .dd image one time. Multiple duplicates caused Autopsy to
freeze.

“Invalid host” errors
Solution: Create a new case → add a new host → attach the image only once.

# Conclusion

Working on this project, honestly taught me way more than I expected. Nothing about
it was “plug it in and it just works”. I had to troubleshoot the VM, fix broken
downloads, rerun Autopsy a dozen times and even switch from downloading a
forensic image to creating my own .dd file when everything else failed. But because of
all that I actually learned the process instead of just following steps. Every error
pushed me to understand the tool deeper. Every fix made the next part easier. By the
time my image finally loaded in Autopsy and I could click through real files from my
own VM it felt like everything came full circle. This project showed me that I’m
capable of figuring things out even when the instructions fall apart and that’s
something I’ll definitely take with me moving forward in cybersecurity and forensics.
