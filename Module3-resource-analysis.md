**Synopsis:** Anyone who wants to start learning about mobile forensics should read this article!!! It talks about the types of data that phones store, the multiple ways to get it (logical vs. physical) and why you need to keep track of everything you do. It’s a little formal but I like that it gives me the “why” behind the steps I’ll be practicing.

**Relevance:5/5** - Perfect starting point, I need a map before I start exploring. This gives me the basics so I won’t feel lost once I’m actually using tools.

**Synopsis:** What happens when you have the evidence ? That's what this one is about… It talks about, safe handling, hashing and the chain of custody. Basically how to make sure the data you collected doesn’t get tossed out in court. It’s less about “how to grab the data” and more about “how to protect it once you have it”.

**Relevance: 5/5** – Super helpful because collecting evidence is only half the battle. This shows me how to protect what I find so it actually counts if anyone questions it later.
