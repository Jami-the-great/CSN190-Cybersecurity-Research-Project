## Brief statement about cybersecurity interests

I’m especially interested in **digital forensics** — investigating digital evidence, analyzing incidents and uncovering how attacks happens. Along with forensics, I enjoy learning about networking, scripting with Python and security tools like Wireshark and Cisco Packet Tracer.
