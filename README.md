## Project Overview

This is my full portfolio for CSN 190, where I officially became a **cyber detective** 🕵

I built a digital forensics lab, using Ubuntu inside VirtualBox, installed Autopsy and investigated a disk image to uncover deleted files and hidden data. It was like CSI except instead of sunglasses and dramatic music..... I had Google and patience. A lot of patience.
This project helped me learn how cybersecurity really works..... Mistakes and all, and that deleted files love to come back to haunt you 👀

## Repository Navigation

| Folder | What’s Inside |
|--------|---------------|
| `/weekly-progress/` | Every assignment, each week’s progress and tutorial on how to build the lab + how to investigate evidence  |
| `/resources/` | All websites, videos, and tools I learned from |
| `/final-paper/` | My article draft and research notes |
| `/presentations/` | Slides or video link |



## Getting Started

To explore the forensic lab setup and investigation:
1. Read `weekly-progress/6.2-setup-log.md` to recreate my Ubuntu + Autopsy environment.
2. Use `weekly-progress/6.3-TUTORIAL.md` to run your own digital investigation.

If you want to explore my findings directly:
- Go to: `final-paper/MEDIUM-ARTICLE-DRAFT-V1.md`

## Results Summary

What I learned:

Throughout this project I built my very first digital forensics lab and actually managed to make Autopsy run without crying..... (too much ). I learned how to recover deleted files, read metadata and basically be nosy in a way that’s legal and professional. Every mistake taught me something, especially how important documentation is when you’re troubleshooting at 2am with only AI as your emotional support.

This project really confirmed that cybersecurity is the path I want to chase. I like solving problems, finding hidden things and understanding how digital evidence tells a story. I started this semester as a curious beginner and now I’m a curious beginner with skills
This project helped me realize that cybersecurity is exactly where I want to be..... And I’m just getting started.
