## Project Overview

This repository includes all of my cybersecurity research project work for CSN 190. I built a digital forensics lab using Ubuntu Linux in VirtualBox and installed Autopsy to analyze a disk image. I recovered deleted data, looked at metadata, and documented the investigation process like a real cybersecurity analyst. This portfolio shows my progress with cybersecurity tools, Linux, virtualization, and digital forensics.

## Repository Navigation

| Folder | What’s Inside |
|--------|---------------|
| `/weekly-progress/` | Every assignment, each week’s progress and tutorial on how to build the lab + how to investigate evidence  |
| `/resources/` | All websites, videos, and tools I learned from |
| `/final-paper/` | My article draft and research notes |
| `/presentations/` | Slides or video link |



## Getting Started

To explore the forensic lab setup and investigation:
1. Read `weekly-progress/6.2-setup-log.md` to recreate my Ubuntu + Autopsy environment.
2. Use `weekly-progress/6.3-TUTORIAL.md` to run your own digital investigation.

If you want to explore my findings directly:
- Go to: `final-paper/MEDIUM-ARTICLE-DRAFT-V1.md`

## Results Summary

What I learned:

- Digital forensics is actually fun (and kinda nosy)
- Linux will test your patience but makes you smarter
- Autopsy can find EVERYTHING… even what you forgot existed 😳
- Documentation is a superpower in cybersecurity 💪

This project helped me realize that cybersecurity is exactly where I want to be — and I’m just getting started.
