## Topic Analysis: Static vs Dynamic Malware Analysis Techniques

### Initial Interest Level

This is a 9/10 because I always been curious of malware not in the sense of creating it but in
figuring out what makes it tick. Most people just see a frozen screen or missing files but I
want to know the why and the how. Static analysis, is like pausing the story to study the script
while dynamic analysis is like pressing play to watch the plot unfold, that mix of behind the
scenes detail and live action makes this topic exciting for me. Because it feels like I be
learning to read the story that the malware is trying to tell.

### Feasibility Assessment

I’ll need a safe lab setup (virtual machine). Because I don’t want to risk breaking my own
computer. Tools like Cuckoo Sandbox and Wireshark, would help me peek under the hood.
Right now, I know the basics (Linux and networking), and a little bit of scripting but I never
actually done malware analysis before. What I’d need to learn, is how to safely test malware,
get comfortable reading basic assembly code and practice spotting the signs malware leaves
when it runs.


### Project vs Research Classification

I’d call this research with a hands on touch. I wouldn’t just be reading articles about malware
analysis I’d actually test out static and dynamic methods myself, and then compare what each
one shows me. The deliverable would be a side by side comparison of static and dynamic
analysis written from my own experience as a beginner testing both out. That way it’s not just
theory, it’s me showing what I actually saw when I put the methods into practice.

### Real-World Application

Malware is at the heart of so many cyberattacks (ransomware, spyware) or trojans sneaking
into a system. Knowing how to analyze it is a big deal because it helps investigators figure
out what happened, how to stop it and how to prevent it from spreading further. By looking at
both static and dynamic methods this project could show how different approaches work in
different situations. Which is super useful in real world incident response.

### Potential Career Connection

This connects right to my goal of working in digital forensics. Malware analysis is something
investigators run into all the time and getting even beginner level practice with it would help
me build the patience, problem solving and tool skills I’ll need. More than anything it makes
me feel like I’d be getting a step closer to doing the real work of figuring out what happened
after an attack.
