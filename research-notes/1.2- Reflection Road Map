### Reflection Roadmap 

My career goals are pretty clear at this point, I’ve already applied to a four year college because I know I want to keep building on everything I’ve started at BCC. While I’ve enjoyed getting a strong understanding in networking, Linux and cybersecurity, my real interest is in digital forensics. I want to explore more into investigating digital evidence, piecing together cyber incidents and helping uncover the “who, what and how” behind attacks. For me transferring to a bachelor’s program is the right move because it will give me more room to specialize, connect with faculty and peers in the field, and open doors to opportunities that will prepare me for a career as a forensic analyst. Right now my strengths mainly come from the work I’ve been doing in class.  Since I don’t yet have professional experience I’ll need to rely on certifications and projects to show my abilities. I’ve built up experience with Cisco Packet Tracer which taught me how networks communicate and how different devices interact. I’ve also been learning Python which gives me a start in scripting and automation…Skills that are important in forensics for things like parsing logs or analyzing evidence faster and on top of that I’ve developed strong study habits. My roadmap shows consistency…Three or more hours of focused work each day no “zero days”, and that discipline is one of my biggest advantages. At the same time I’m aware of the gaps I need to work on. Since I don’t have formal job experience yet certifications like Security+ are going to be key in proving I have the baseline knowledge employers expect. I also need to start building a portfolio to show what I can do things like lab write ups, Packet Tracer network designs or Python scripts for forensic analysis. Another area I need to grow in is communication. The video I watched made it clear that explaining technical findings in a simple clear way is just as important as having the skills. Programming is another area to strengthen. While Python is a great start I’d like to become more confident with it and eventually learn Java which is highly requested in the job market. This CSN 190 research project is helping me turn all of these ideas into an actual action plan, Instead of just keeping my goals in my head the roadmap forces me to lay them out step by step and hold myself accountable. It connects the coursework I’ve already done to the certifications I need to complete and the portfolio I need to build. More importantly it gives me a way to measure progress and see where I need to fix. For this semester my timeline is simple but focused. First I’ll complete Security+ to prove I have a good understanding of the basics. Second I’ll post at least one project to GitHub maybe a Python automation script or a Packet Tracer lab write up. Third I’ll update my LinkedIn profile so it reflects my current skills and goals. And finally, I’ll practice interview skills so I’m ready when opportunities come my way.  These steps will not only prepare me for transferring to a four year college but also bring me closer to my long term goal of working in digital forensics.
