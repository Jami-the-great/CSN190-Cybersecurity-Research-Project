# Digital Evidence Collection for Mobile Devices
### Research–Project Hybrid Abstract
Phones have quietly become the new witnesses in digital investigations…. Every call,
message or photo holds a small piece of a much bigger story, and learning how to collect that
story without changing it is what this project is all about. My focus is on using open source
tools like SleuthKit, Andriller and iLEAPP to safely extract, verify and analyze data from
Android devices. I’ll be setting up a small lab environment, to simulate what a real digital
forensic analyst would do, documenting each step from imaging to analysis.
 
 What I really want from this project is to understand the “why” behind every step…. Not
just how to use the tools but instead what it means to handle digital evidence…. With honesty
and care. I’ll test, how reliable each tool is, where it falls short and how small mistakes can
change results. But my main goal….. Is to build a simple affordable workflow that feels
realistic for beginners like me !!!!! Showing that careful/ honest work can go, just as far as
expensive tools. Eventually, I believe that this project will help me understand how digital
evidence tells a story and how much respect and time…. it takes to uncover it the right way.

### Self Evaluation
learning at my own pace, finding what works and slowly building the mindset I’ll need for
real investigations one day. When I wrote this abstract, I made sure to include everything.
(The background, the problem, what I’m doing, how I’m doing it, and what I hope to learn
from it). I explained, why mobile devices matter in digital forensics and how I’ll use tools
like SleuthKit, Andriller and iLEAPP to run my own small lab setup. I made sure it sounds
like something I would actually do not just a list of steps, by keeping the tone natural and
focused on the meaning, behind the work. What makes my abstract specific and clear, is that
it describes the exact tools I’ll be using and what I plan to test, how reliable each tool is,
where it falls short and how to build a beginner friendly workflow. The hardest part, was
finding that balance between keeping it short and still letting my interest show. I think it lines
up well with my plan from 4.1 because it shows growth…. Not just in learning the tools but
in learning how to think and work like a forensic analyst.
