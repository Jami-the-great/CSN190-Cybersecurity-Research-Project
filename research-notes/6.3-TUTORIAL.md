# Introduction
For this project I worked with the Digital-Forensics-Guide repository from GitHub. A
huge resource packed guide, for anyone learning about digital forensics. It’s not a
program you run but more like an opensource textbook that collects useful tools and
explains what they’re used for. My goal was to explore it through VS Code with
GitHub Copilot, understand how to navigate its documentation and pick one beginner
friendly forensic tool to test out for real. I chose to actually test in my VM: Autopsy.

For my specific task I followed the section in the repository, that explains how to use
Autopsy a popular forensic GUI used to analyze disk images. My goal was to~
• Launch Autopsy
• Create a case
• Add a test image
• Analyze the file system (view files, extract data, view metadata)
My goal was simple..... Take a real test disk image, open it in Autopsy and explore
what kind of evidence a forensic examiner would actually see. I created a case, added
a host, mounted the image and went through files, timestamps, and even keyword
search results. It was cool, seeing how Autopsy breaks everything down so vividly.
This matters because disk image investigations are basically the heart of digital
forensics...... Every deleted file, strange timestamp, or hidden text file tells a story.
And getting hands on with Autopsy helped me understand how investigators actually
uncover those stories. This project was genuinely hands on and emotional in the best
way (frustrating, funny, tiring and extremely satisfying) once the evidence finally
popped up on Autopsy.
# Prerequisites.... Before starting I needed a few things ready forsure
• VS Code (with Git + GitHub Copilot enabled)
• Ubuntu VM (VirtualBox)
• Autopsy installed (version 4.20.1)
• Firefox browser
• Patience because Autopsy WILL break at least once!!!!!
• Terminal access/ Basic terminal knowledge....

# Step By Step Tutorial
Below are the exact steps I took, including the moments that worked smoothly and the
ones that made me question my life choices.

## Step 1 — Open the Digital-Forensics-Guide Repository in VS Code

I opened the entire GitHub repo in VS Code to explore its sections on disk analysis,
forensic imaging, evidence handling and Autopsy references.
