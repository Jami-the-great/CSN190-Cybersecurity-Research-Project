## Part A: Comprehensive Topic Analysis
## Topic 1: Digital Evidence Collection for Mobile Devices
### 1. Feasibility Assessment
 This topic is right in my comfort zone but still pushes me to grow, I’d be focusing
on how to collect, preserve and analyze data from mobile devices, basically doing what
digital forensic analysts do every day.
I’ll rate my current skills a 3/5 — I know my way around Linux and networking. But I’m still
learning the deeper parts like chain of custody and hashing and verifying data integrity.
  ### 2. Learning and Growth Potential
This topic connects directly to what I want to do in the future, work as a digital
forensic analyst. It’s not just about technology it’s about investigation, problem solving and
finding truth through data. I like the idea that behind every file or timestamp there’s a story
waiting to be told. It’s part logic, part curiosity and part detective work.
### 3. Realistic Planning
 - Ambitious Goal- Do a side by side comparison of Android and iOS extractions and
write a short forensic report.
- Realistic Target- Successfully extract and analyze data, from an Android image
using open source tools.
- Minimum Outcome- Show that I can use forensic tools properly and explain what
kind of evidence…They can uncover.

## Topic 2: Static vs Dynamic Malware Analysis
### 1. Feasibility Assessment
This topic is more on the cybersecurity side and it’s one that really makes me curious.
The goal is to compare two different methods, static analysis (looking at code) and dynamic
analysis (seeing how it behaves when you run it). I’d use, MobSF and malwareHunter to see
how each approach works.
I’d rate my current skills a 2.5/5. I’m solid in Python and virtual machines but malware
analysis is still new for me. MobSF and malwareHunter are both open source so I can use
documentation and GitHub issues to troubleshoot.
### 2. Learning and Growth Potential
This one connects to the threat intelligence side of cybersecurity which I also find
really interesting. I’d get to see how malware hides, acts and adapts…. Which is like
watching a digital crime unfold in slow motion. I’ll be building skills in analysis, logging and
report writing, all of which fit right into my future goals.
### 3. Realistic Planning
- Ambitious Goal- Test multiple samples and measure how accurate each tool’s
detection is.
- Realistic Target- Run safe malware samples, through MobSF and malwareHunter
and compare their results.
- Minimum Outcome- Explain what each method does best and what I learned from
the results.

## Part C: Final Topic Selection
I’m choosing Digital Evidence Collection for Mobile Devices, as my final topic
because it fits naturally with what I want to do long term. I’ll be simulating a mini
investigation collecting, verifying and turning it into something that tells a clear story. It’s
real, hands on work that helps me think like an investigator not just a student following
instructions. This topic feels like more than just an assignment….It’s practice for my future.
It combines, the technical side of cybersecurity with the investigative side I love. I like that it
pushes me to think critically and pay attention to small details…. The kind of mindset that
really matters in forensics.
### Three-Tier Plan:
- Ambitious Goal- Compare Android and iOS extractions and write a small forensic
style case report.
- Realistic Target- Complete a clean Android extraction, hash the data and document
what I find.
 ### Minimum Outcome- 
Show that I can properly use the tools and identify at least a few key artifacts, that could be used as evidence.
### The Learning Value:
Even if everything doesn’t go perfectly…. This project will teach me a lot about how
digital forensics actually works in practice. I’ll be learning how to work with forensic
software, manage evidence responsibly and understand the story data tells. But more than
anything, it’s a step toward where I want to be…. Helping uncover truth through technology
and building the foundation for my future in digital forensics and threat intelligence.
