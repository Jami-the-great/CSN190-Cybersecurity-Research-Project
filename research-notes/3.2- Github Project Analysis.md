## GitHub Project 1 — Digital-Forensics-Guide
- Citation: mikeroyal. (n.d.). GitHub - mikeroyal/Digital-Forensics-Guide: Digital Forensics
Guide. Learn all about Digital Forensics, Computer Forensics, Mobile device Forensics,
Network Forensics, and Database Forensics. GitHub. Retrieved September 26, 2025, from
https://github.com/mikeroyal/Digital-Forensics-Guide
- Type: Educational / Reference Guide
- Synopsis: This repo feels like a cheat sheet. It doesn’t do the work for you but it lines up all
the big concepts, tools and links so you’re not lost in the air. Mobile device forensics,
computer forensics, network forensics and database forensics is all in here. I see it as the
“GPS” before you start driving… The only catch, it’s more guide than hands on so you still
need to bring your own tools.
- Stars/forks: 2.3k stars, 252 forks (active popularity)
- Activity: 81 commits, includes “Getting Started with Digital Forensics” scripts and a
glossary.
- Strengths: Excellent for learning for finding tools you didn’t know and for linking out to
other repos. It’s a strong “first stop” when exploring the field.
- Link: https://github.com/mikeroyal/Digital-Forensics-Guide
- Relevance: 4/5 — Perfect for orientation but not enough by itself. You’ll need other tools in
play to actually collect and preserve evidence.

## GitHub Project 2 — SleuthKit
- Citation: sleuthkit. (2025). The Sleuth Kit (TSK). GitHub.
https://github.com/sleuthkit/sleuthkit
- Type: Forensic Toolkit
- Synopsis: SleuthKit is the old reliable of digital forensics. It lets you dig into disk images,
partitions, file systems, uncovering deleted files, hidden metadata and activity trails. It’s the
kind of tool investigators quietly rely on when they need solid, defensible evidence. It doesn’t
hold your hand or wow you with a flashy interface, but that’s kind of the point ( it’s serious,
raw, and respected in the field).
- Link: https://github.com/sleuthkit/sleuthkit
- Relevance: 5/5 — Exactly what evidence work requires, depth, reliability and credibility in
court.

# Topic 2: Static vs Dynamic Malware Analysis

## GitHub Project 3 — MobSF
- Citation: MobSF. (n.d.). GitHub - MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF: Mobile
Security Framework (MobSF) is an automated, all-in-one mobile application
(Android/iOS/Windows) pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework
capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. GitHub. Retrieved September 26, 2025,
from https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF
- Type: Static + Dynamic Analysis Framework
- Synopsis: MobSF is an awesome all in one tool for mobile app security. It can perform static
analysis (code, manifest, binaries), dynamic analysis (behavior/runtime) and even malware
scanning for Android, iOS and Windows mobile platforms. It includes dashboards, reporting,
hooks for instrumenting apps, etc.
- Stars/forks: high community use and visibility.
- Activity: actively maintained with updates and issue tracking ongoing.
- Strengths: covers static and dynamic views, rich UI and good for experimentation.
- Limitations: setup may be complicated (emulators, dependencies) possibly heavy resource
usage. Also not strictly “evidence collection” in the legal sense more toward app
security/malware screening.
- Link: https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF
- Relevance: 5/5 — This one ties both of my topics together(mobile devices + malware
behavior). Definitely demo worthy.

## GitHub Project 4 — malwareHunter
-Citation: Abdesslem. (n.d.). GitHub - abdesslem/malwareHunter: Static and
automated/dynamic malware analysis. GitHub. https://github.com/abdesslem/malwareHunter
- Type: Malware Static/Dynamic Analysis Utility / Tool
- Synopsis: malwareHunter is designed to automate parts of malware analysis (static and
dynamic) aspects. It helps in identifying malware signatures, behaviors and runs certain
analysis modules. It reminds me of starting out in Python…. Short scripts that do one thing
well. It keeps things simple enough that you can actually focus on learning instead of
wrestling with the setup.
- Limitation: it’s not as deep as Cuckoo or MobSF but easier to digest.
- Link: https://github.com/abdesslem/malwareHunter
- Relevance: 4/5 — Not the star of the show but a great sidekick for learning and
experimenting.

### Comparison Notes
- Forensics Tools: Digital Forensics Guide is the map while SleuthKit is the shovel. They
balance each other out…. One shows you what’s out there and the other lets you actually dig.
