# Topic 1 – Digital Evidence Collection for Mobile Devices

### Resource 1
- Citation: FOUNDATIONS OF MOBILE FORENSICS: AN ACADEMIC APPROACH.
(2024). Issues in Information Systems. https://iacis.org/iis/2024/3_iis_2024_94-108.pdf
- Type: Academic Article
- Synopsis: Anyone who wants to start learning about mobile forensics should read this
article!!! It talks about the types of data that phones store, the multiple ways to get it (logical
vs. physical) and why you need to keep track of everything you do. It’s a little formal but I
like that it gives me the “why” behind the steps I’ll be practicing.
- Link: https://iacis.org/iis/2024/3_iis_2024_94-108.pdf
- Relevance: 5/5 - Perfect starting point, I need a map before I start exploring. This gives me
the basics so I won’t feel lost once I’m actually using tools.

### Resource 2
- Citation: Guttman, B., White, D. R., Software & Systems Division, & Walraven, T. (2022).
Digital Evidence Preservation: Considerations for Evidence Handlers. In U.S. Department of
Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology, G. M. Raimondo, & L. E.
Locascio, NIST Interagency Report.
https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8387.pdf
- Type: Government Technical Report
- Synopsis: What happens when you have the evidence ? That's what this one is about… It
talks about, safe handling, hashing and the chain of custody. Basically how to make sure the
data you collected doesn’t get tossed out in court. It’s less about “how to grab the data” and
more about “how to protect it once you have it”.
- Link: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8387.pdf
- Relevance: 5/5 – Super helpful because collecting evidence is only half the battle. This
shows me how to protect what I find so it actually counts if anyone questions it later.

### Resource 3

- Citation: Peter Brockie. (2018, February 2). Cellebrite UFED Cellphone Forensic Extraction
Device teardown YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LLGGCXH9MQ
- Type: Webinar/Technical Video
- Synopsis: This webinar digs into Cellebrite UFED which is basically the tool investigators
use in the field. It shows what the device can do and how it works and talk through how it
connects to phones. Seeing the device in action connects the dots between theory and the
physical process of extraction.
- Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LLGGCXH9MQ
- Relevance: 5/5 — Honestly this video helped everything click. Seeing the UFED in action
made the whole extraction process feel way more real. It’s one thing to read about how data
gets pulled from phones…. It’s another to actually watch the tool do its thing. This is the kind
of tech I’d be working with so yeah super relevant.

### Resource 4
- Citation: Mobile forensics - iOS and Android. (n.d.). YouTube.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TFjEg6g2bW4
- Type: Educational Video
- Synopsis: This video, doesn’t just talk about mobile forensics. It actually shows it happening
on iOS and Android. You can see each steps, the tools and the differences between the two
systems. To be honest It’s super beginner friendly and easy to follow.
- Link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TFjEg6g2bW4
- Relevance: 5/5 – I’m a visual learner so watching someone do it, helps me picture my own
first run through instead of just guessing from text

# Topic 2 – Static vs Dynamic Malware Analysis

atic-and-Dynamic-Malware-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning.pdf
- Type: Academic / Research Article
- Synopsis: This paper experiments by pulling ~92 static features from executable binaries and
~2,300 dynamic features from malware run in a Cuckoo sandbox. Then the authors trained
machine learning models on both sets to see which gave better results. Static analysis
surprisingly performed slightly better (around 99% accuracy) because some malware was
smart enough to notice it was in a sandbox and hid its real behavior. It’s technical but easy
enough to follow and gives real numbers that show the strengths and weaknesses of each
approach.

c1f/Static-and-Dynamic-Malware-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning.pdf
- Relevance: 5/5 – I really like this paper because it doesn’t just talk theory. It shows real
numbers on how static and dynamic analysis actually perform. I like that it proves static can
sometimes beat dynamic when malware tries to hide in a sandbox. That’s the kind of insight I
want !!! real numbers that help me understand what’s actually happening and make my
project feel backed in real testing not just theory.

- Citation: Coan, J. (2022, June 14). Cybersecurity skills: dynamic and static malware
analysis. CyberMaxx.
https://www.cybermaxx.com/resources/dynamic-and-static-malware-analysis/
- Type: Industry Blog / Technical Article
- Synopsis: This article breaks things down in a straightforward way, It explains what each
method really means. Like how static is all about looking at the code without running it and
how dynamic is about watching what the malware does in a safe space. It even points out that
some malware can tell when it’s being watched and hide its bad side.
- Link: https://www.cybermaxx.com/resources/dynamic-and-static-malware-analysis/
Relevance: 4/5 – This article breaks things down in a straightforward way. Explaining what
each method really means and how they’re used to understand and investigate malware.

detection. Procedia Computer Science, 46, 804–811.
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2015.02.149
- Type: Academic Article
- Synopsis: This paper talks about catching brand new malware by looking at the API calls it
makes. The authors collect data from both static and dynamic analysis and use machine
learning to predict if something’s malicious. It’s definitely technical but still understandable
and shows how the two methods, can work together.
- Link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2015.02.149
- Relevance: 5/5 – I like this because it shows a smart way to combine static and dynamic
analysis to catch even unknown threats. Giving me ideas I can use.

### Resource 4
- Citation: Malware Analysis Masterclass 2025 | Static + Dynamic Tricks. (n.d.). YouTube.
Retrieved September 27, 2025, from https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QYq_DzLJJng
- Synopsis: This masterclass walks through how analysts actually use both static and dynamic
techniques side by side. The presenter first shows how to inspect malware without running it,
looking at file headers, strings and other tell tale artifacts and then moves into a sandbox to
watch the malware’s behavior when it actually runs. You get to see the tools in action and
understand why some malware will even try to hide when it detects a sandbox.
- Link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QYq_DzLJJng
- Relevance: 5/5 – I love this because it makes the process feel real. You literally get to sit
back and watch someone pull apart the malware file and inspect its signatures and headers.
Then you see it run in a sandbox to catch its live behaviour.
